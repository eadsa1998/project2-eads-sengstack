This is the README for all the .sql files for the database project 2 for 
Ashley Eads and Donnie Sengstack. It contains descriptions of all the files 
and the order in which they should be run to successfully set up the database 
side of the project.

Run files in this order:
	P2-CreateDatabase.sql - This file contains the create database and 
create table statements for the election_tweets database and the megatables 
for the datasets we used for the project, as well as the load in statements 
for all the data files.
	P2-NormalizedTables.sql - This file contains the create table
statements for all the normalized tables in the database, as well as the load
in statements to get the data from the megatables to the normalized tables.
	P2-AdvancedFeatures.sql - This file contains the code for all the
advanced features, like views, stored prodecures, and triggers.
